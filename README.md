# DataCopy.io
## Introduction
Testing of Discord.py
Copies content of a discord server (after activating) to the terminal so you don't have to open discord to check messages while staying invisible.
----
## Code Edit
Replace `{your-secret}` with the actual secret token of your discord bot.
Additionally, you would need to download the `discord` module
To Install, Enter the following to your command line/ terminal
```
pip install discord
```

## Suggestion
I suggest to store you token at a place where only you can access as it is often forgettable.
Also, you can head out to Youtube in case you don't know how to create a discord bot and other related subjects.
Also it is worth mentioning that the `discord` module is discontinued but still can be used.
